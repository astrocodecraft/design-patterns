The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the construction of complex objects step by step. It is useful when an object needs to be created with many optional components and configuration options. A real-world use case for the Builder Pattern is in creating a configurable report generator in a data analysis application.

In such an application, you might need to generate reports that can vary significantly in their content and format. Some reports may include charts, others tables, and some a mix of both, with various formatting options. Using the Builder Pattern, you can create a flexible and maintainable way to construct these diverse reports.

Take a look [this implementation](./report_builder.py):

* `ReportBuilder` is an abstract interface that defines the steps to build a report.
* `DataReportBuilder` is a concrete builder that implements the `ReportBuilder` interface and builds the `DataReport` object.
* `DataReport` is the product class representing the complex object being built.
* `ReportDirector` is an optional class that defines the order in which to execute the building steps to create specific types of reports.
* The client code demonstrates how to use the director to construct a simple and a detailed report.

This approach allows for the creation of highly configurable reports, with the possibility of easily adding new types of contents and formatting options without altering existing code. It encapsulates the construction logic and separates it from the representation, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
