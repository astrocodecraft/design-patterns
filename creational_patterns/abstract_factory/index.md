The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. A common use case for the Abstract Factory pattern is in the development of cross-platform GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkits.

Imagine you are developing a GUI toolkit that needs to work across multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux. Each platform has different ways of rendering widgets like buttons, text boxes, and checkboxes. The Abstract Factory pattern allows you to define an interface for creating sets of related objects (like buttons, text boxes, etc.), and then implement this interface in different factory classes, each tailored to a specific platform.

Take a look [this implementation](./game_factory.py):

* `GameFactory` is an abstract class with methods to create graphics renderer, sound player, and input handler.
* `PCGameFactory` and `MobileGameFactory` are concrete factories implementing the `GameFactory` interface, returning PC or Mobile-specific implementations.
* Abstract product classes `GraphicsRenderer`, `SoundPlayer`, and `InputHandler` are defined, with concrete implementations like `PCGraphicsRenderer`, `PCSoundPlayer`, `PCInputHandler`, `MobileGraphicsRenderer`, `MobileSoundPlayer`, and `MobileInputHandler`.
* `game_client` is a function that demonstrates using the factory to create and use game components. This function is agnostic of the platform specifics.

This design allows for easy extension to new platforms (like consoles) and keeps the game logic separated from platform-specific implementations, adhering to the principle of separation of concerns and making the code more maintainable.
