# Welcome to Design Patterns in Software Engineer üêç ‚ú®
In the realm of software engineering, design patterns are fundamental, offering solutions to common problems encountered in software design. These patterns provide a template for how to solve a problem in a particular context, making software design more efficient and maintainable. This post delves into the world of design patterns through the lens of Python, a language known for its simplicity and readability.

# About this Repository
This repository is a curated collection of design pattern examples, each of which demonstrates a specific design pattern in Python. From creational patterns like Singleton and Factory to structural patterns like Adapter and Decorator, and finally to behavioral patterns like Observer and Strategy, this repository serves as a go-to resource for Python developers looking to deepen their understanding of design patterns.

# Patterns Included:
* Singleton
* Factory
* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Prototype
* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Proxy
* Chain of Responsibility
* Observer
* Strategy
Visitor

Each pattern is contained in its own directory, complete with a Python script showcasing its implementation and a README explaining its purpose and application.

# How to Use this Repository
To explore a pattern, simply navigate to its respective directory. There, you will find a Python script with the implementation and a README file that offers a deeper insight into the pattern. You can clone the repository, run the scripts, and modify them to see how changes affect the pattern's behavior.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/herchila/design-patterns.git
cd design-patterns
```
